# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
My goals in this project are to start understanding how to work with APIs as well as how to manipulate the data retrieved from them. In addition, building a clean dataset inside Python and then transforming it into a database. Since I have only ever worked with data from SAP databases in my work history this was a new and exciting challenge for me. 

## Process
### process data from APIs into dataframes and then CSV files. L
### Merge the two datasets and then join with the city-bikes data for one large table
###do some xploratory analysis on the data
###try and create a regression model that makes sense

## Results
I found the data from the Fourquare API to be incomplete while the Yelp API to be much more complete and easy to work with. The FourSquare APi did not seem to have any data in the Ratings Section when I pulled it in... so i excluded it, then realizing I was going to need the empty columns down the line anyways. I ran out of api requests so luckily I saved the data to a csv file and then pushed to the git hub repository.

In total, the yelp dataset resulted in over double the amount of restaurants and had a more complete datasetwith reviews...



## Challenges 
Overall I feel like this was a very challenging project in such a short amount of time. I hard a hard time finding a visualizaiton that made sense for the this project in addition to having an issue finding a regression model that did not have co-linearity or had logic that truly made sense to build of of. Not having foursquare ratings made this even more of a challenge as I really only had one dataset to work with. 

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I certainly would have spent more time working with the API data to figure out if it was something I was doing incorrectly with the FourSquare API. I also would have spent more time looking for features that could have properly predicted ratings, etc... Something that would have been interesting would have been total ratings, categories of restaurants, and bikes available to avg ratings.

Overall, if there was more time to work on this project I could have properly explored these datasets and APIs to build out a proper project.
